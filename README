OSMCoastline
============

OSMCoastline extracts the coastline from an OSM planet file and assembles all
the pieces into polygons for use in map renderers etc.

This is a preliminary version that needs more work.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

Osmium
    http://github.com/joto/osmium
    http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmium

boost (several libraries)
    http://www.boost.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-dev

zlib (for PBF support)
    http://www.zlib.net/
    Debian/Ubuntu: zlib1g-dev

GDAL (for OGR support)
    http://gdal.org/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libgdal1-dev
    (must be built with GEOS support which is the true for Debian/Ubuntu
    packages)

GEOS (for assembling multipolygons etc.)
    http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
    Debian/Ubuntu: libgeos-dev


BUILDING
--------

You'll need all the prerequisites including Osmium installed.

Run "make" to build the "osmcoastline" program.

Run "make clean" to clean up.


TESTING
-------

Run the script "runtest.sh". It will read the supplied "testdata.osm" and
create output in the testdata directory.

You can use the supplied "coastline.qgs" QGIS project file to open the
output with QGIS.


RUNNING
-------

Run "osmcoastline PLANET-FILE OUTPUT-DIRECTORY", for example "osmcoastline
planet.osm.pbf coastline". This will create the given OUTPUT-DIRECTORY
and write several shapefiles into it.


OUTPUT
------

Currently four output shapefiles are created:

* error_lines
  Lines that have errors (for instance not closed rings or self-intersections).

* error_points
  Problematic points such as intersections.

* polygons
  Finished assembled land polygons.

* rings
  Coastline rings as linestrings.

Currently all output is in WGS84.


LICENSE
-------

Osmium is available under the GNU GPL version 3 or later.
