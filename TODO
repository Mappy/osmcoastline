OSMCoastline TODO
=================

* (optionally) close open rings by finding open ends that are close
* (optionally) check for overlapping polygons
* make different outputs and optional features available through command line options
* set sensible return codes depending on errors found etc.
    Something like:
        0 - everything ok
        1 - found small (fixable) errors only
        2 - possibly bad output from larger errors
        3 - fatal errors (can't write output etc.)
        4 - command line arguments wrong etc.
* write out statistics somehow?
* add transformation to mercator (and maybe other projections)
* split large polygons
    - probably depending on projection used
