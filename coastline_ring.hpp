/**
 * The CoastlineRing class models a (possibly unfinished) ring of
 * coastline, ie. a closed list of points.
 *
 * CoastlineRing objects are created from a way. If the way is
 * already closed we are done. If not, more ways will be added
 * later until the ring is closed.
 *
 * The CoastlineRing keeps track of all the node IDs needed for
 * the ring.
 *
 * To get a unique ID for the coastline ring, the minimum way
 * ID is also kept.
 *
 * By definition coastlines in OSM are tagged as natural=coastline
 * and the land is always to the *left* of the way, the water to
 * the right. So a ring around an island is going counter-clockwise.
 * In normal GIS use, outer rings of polygons are often expected
 * to be clockwise, and inner rings are count-clockwise. So, if we
 * are describing land polygons, the OSM convention is just the
 * opposite of the GIS convention. Because of this the methods
 * on CoastlineRing that create OGR geometries will actually turn
 * the rings around.
